        <h1>Builds</h1>
        <p>Theres two main yone builds i will cover.</p>

</header>



   <main>

    <div class="main_text"> 
        <h1>Runes</h1>
            <p> The best runes for yone currently is lethal tempo since attack speed is vital on him due to his abiltities scaling off of attack speed. Resolve second for some extra tankiness since yone can be pretty squishy at times. This makes trading much easier. Sometimes boneplating may be picked instead second wind if playing against heavy burst. 
                </p>

                </div>
 
                


    <div class="main_text">
        <h1>Level priority</h1>
                <p> You will always want to max Q into E, the damage scales the best this way.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="main_img"> 
                <img src="./images/Screenshot_14.png" alt="Image of Yones E ability" width="500px">
            </div>

            <div class="main_text">
                <h1>Crit build</h1>
                        <p> You want to rush berzerker's boots and noonquiver, and then build Immortal Shieldbow into IE, the rest is situational. <br>If you are snowballing early it will be worth to buy a zeal for the stats since its very important for yone. <br> You can choose to build this into a mortal reminder at any point of the game. This build will deal the most dps during the mid and late game.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="main_img"> 
                        <img src="./images/Screenshot_15.png" alt="Image of Yones E ability" width="500px">
                    </div>
                    
            <div class="main_text">
                <h1>Tank build</h1>
                        <p> You want to rush berzerker's boots and into BORK, and then into sunfire aegis. <br> The rest is situational, but deaths dance is pretty much a must have. Zeal is also viable here due to the stats being very efficient to Yone. Building the zeal into a mortal reminder is a must because of the 50% crit and attack speed you get, since you lack a lot of it in this build.</p>
